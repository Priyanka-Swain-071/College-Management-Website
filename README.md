# College-Management-Website
This is a College Management Website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
The given website has been made keeping in views to provide facilities like :
-> hassle-free management of the whole administrative process
-> allows keeping relevant information about all the students, guardians, teachers, and staff members so that it can be accessed
   by the concerned authority anytime as and when required
-> by eliminating loads of manual work and repetitive tasks, the system helps in saving their time, money and resources
-> acess/search information
-> login in to the system through the first page
-> view all academic details as well as details of student and any faculty member
-> an admin privilege who can read, update as well as remove any data

Right now I have implemented the front-end part of the project only using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.In the front-end part we provide the main page having a
navigation barc containing all essentials links as well as a login button. History and vision and about the college and a footer section. I have provided
a single registration and login page for admin, student, as well as for facultty.Each of them get their respective login modal by just clicking on the
name of user type on the modal header(Admin, Student, Faculty) which has been made by using "onclick" event of Javascript.
There is also an hardcoded static page to show the profile details.

Future scope:
In future I will add backend using NodeJs and Mongdb database to make it dynamic and storing and manipulating data.
Also I will replicate the complete project using ReactJs,NodeJS, ExpressJs, and MongoDb for better user experience.
To do so I have already started learning ReactJs and improving my skills on Fetch API in Javascript and further will have knowledge on NodeJs
